# bitgo-utxo-lib code owners and first officers will automatically be requested
# for review whenever a pull request touches the files they own.  Each line is
# a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners and first officers will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.  So if
# a pull request only touches files in one specific dir, only these owners will
