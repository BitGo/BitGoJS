# BitGo SDK TypeScript Examples

## Prerequisites

You will need node and npm installed locally. You can find information on how to do this in the root README.md.

## Running the examples

First, run `yarn install` from the root directory of the repository.

Then change into the `examples/ts` directory and use `npx ts-node` to run the desired example:

```
$ cd examples/ts
$ npx ts-node get-wallet.ts
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide the given values if you would like to use the same variables for multiple examples.

**Note**: Be sure to complete the required TODO's for each script, such as adding your access token or providing your wallet ID.
