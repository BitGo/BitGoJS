# BitGo SDK Typescript Examples

## Prerequisites

You will need node and npm installed locally. You can find information on how to do this in the root README.md.

## Running the examples

First, run `npm install` in the `modules/core` directory.

```
$ cd modules/core && npm install 
```

Then change into the `example/ts` directory and use `npx ts-node` to run the  desired example:

```
$ cd example/ts
$ npx ts-node get-wallet.ts
```

**Note**: Be sure to complete the required TODO's for each script, such as adding your access token or providing your wallet ID.
