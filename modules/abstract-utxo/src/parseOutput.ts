/**
 * Check an address which failed initial validation to see if it's the base address of a migrated v1 bch wallet.
 *
 * The wallet in question could be a migrated SafeHD BCH wallet, and the transaction we
 * are currently parsing is trying to spend change back to the v1 wallet base address.
 *
 * It does this since we don't allow new address creation for these wallets,
 * and instead return the base address from the v1 wallet when a new address is requested.
 * If this new address is requested for the purposes of spending change back to the wallet,
 * the change will go to the v1 wallet base address. This address *is* on the wallet,
 * but it will still cause an error to be thrown by verifyAddress, since the derivation path
 * used for this address is non-standard. (I have seen these addresses derived using paths m/0/0 and m/101,
 * whereas the v2 addresses are derived using path  m/0/0/${chain}/${index}).
 *
 * This means we need to check for this case explicitly in this catch block, and classify
 * these types of outputs as internal instead of external. Failing to do so would cause the
 * transaction's implicit external outputs (ie, outputs which go to addresses not specified in
 * the recipients array) to add up to more than the 150 basis point limit which we enforce on
 * pay-as-you-go outputs (which should be the only implicit external outputs on our transactions).
 *
 * The 150 basis point limit for implicit external sends is enforced in verifyTransaction,
 * which calls this function to get information on the total external/internal spend amounts
 * for a transaction. The idea here is to protect from the transaction being maliciously modified
 * to add more implicit external spends (eg, to an attacker-controlled wallet).
 *
 * See verifyTransaction for more information on how transaction prebuilds are verified before signing.
 *
 * @param wallet {Wallet} wallet which is making the transaction
 * @param currentAddress {string} address to check for externality relative to v1 wallet base address
