# @bitgo/sdk-coin-cosmos

Configurable common module for Cosmos SDK chains, using @bitgo/abstract-cosmos for reduced coin integration boilerplate.

This module provides a shared implementation for Cosmos SDK-based coins, allowing new Cosmos chains to be added through configuration in statics rather than requiring individual coin modules.
