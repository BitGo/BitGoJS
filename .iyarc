# Excluded because:
# - Lerna requires tar v6, but no patched v6 exists (fix only in v7.5.3)
# - Forcing tar v7.5.3 breaks lerna's packDirectory API
# - This CVE affects archive EXTRACTION (unpacking malicious symlinks/hardlinks)
# - Lerna only uses tar for PACKING
GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97

# Excluded because:
# - Transitive dependency through lerna and yeoman-generator, which currently pin tar to a
#   < 7.5.4 range; We only use their tar integration for
#   archive PACKING, not extraction,
GHSA-r6q2-hw4h-h46w

# Excluded because:
# - Transitive dependency through lerna and yeoman-generator requiring tar < 7.5.4
# - This CVE affects tar's extraction process with specially crafted archives
# - Our usage is limited to archive PACKING operations only, not extraction
GHSA-34x7-hfp2-rc4v

# Excluded because:
# - Transitive dependency through lerna, depcheck, glob, mocha, yeoman-generator
# - minimatch 10.x introduces breaking API changes incompatible with lerna v9.0.4
#   (changed from default export to named exports, causing "is not a function" error)
# - This CVE (ReDoS in minimatch <10.2.1) affects glob pattern matching with repeated wildcards
# - Our usage is dev-time tooling only (build, test, file search)
# - Mitigated by controlled inputs (our own build scripts, not user-provided patterns)
# - No practical exploit path as all glob patterns are hardcoded in our codebase
