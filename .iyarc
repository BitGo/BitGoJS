# Excluded because:
# - Lerna requires tar v6, but no patched v6 exists (fix only in v7.5.3)
# - Forcing tar v7.5.3 breaks lerna's packDirectory API
# - This CVE affects archive EXTRACTION (unpacking malicious symlinks/hardlinks)
# - Lerna only uses tar for PACKING
GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97

# Excluded because:
# - Same tar v6 dependency issue as above
# - Affects only dev dependencies (lerna, yeoman-generator)
# - Not exploitable in our build context
