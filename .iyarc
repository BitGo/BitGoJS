# Excluded because:
# - Lerna requires tar v6, but no patched v6 exists (fix only in v7.5.3)
# - Forcing tar v7.5.3 breaks lerna's packDirectory API
# - This CVE affects archive EXTRACTION (unpacking malicious symlinks/hardlinks)
# - Lerna only uses tar for PACKING
GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97

# Excluded because:
# - Transitive dependency through lerna and yeoman-generator, which currently pin tar to a
#   < 7.5.4 range; We only use their tar integration for
#   archive PACKING, not extraction,
